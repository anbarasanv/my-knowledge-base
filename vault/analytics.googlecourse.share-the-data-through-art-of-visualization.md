## Data Visualization

The graphic representation and presentation of data.

## Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization

### The McCandless Method

![What Makes a Good Visualization?](/assets/images/2022-05-16-08-02-25.png)

- **Information**: the data you are working with
- **Story**: a clear and compelling narrative or concept
- **Goal**: a specific objective or function for the
- **Visual**: form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

Note: One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.

- What is the practical question?
- What does the data say?
- What does the visual say?

Note: This checklist helps you think about your data viz from the perspective of your audience and decide if your visual is communicating your data effectively to them or not. In addition to these frameworks, there are some other building blocks that can help you construct your data visualizations.

### Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels

Creating effective visuals means leveraging what we know about how the brain works, and then using specific visual elements to communicate the information effectively. Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels.

#### Marks

M​arks are basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities:

**Position** - Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks
![position](/assets/images/2022-05-16-08-10-44.png)

**Size** - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is
![size](/assets/images/2022-05-16-08-11-25.png)

**Shape** - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it
![shape](/assets/images/2022-05-16-08-12-09.png)

**Color** - What color the mark is

#### Channels

C​hannels are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data. Channels are basically marks that have been used to visualize data. Channels will vary in terms of how effective they are at communicating data based on three elements:

**Accuracy** - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented?

For example, color is very accurate when communicating categorical differences, like apples and oranges. But it is much less effective when distinguishing quantitative data like 5 from 5.5.

**Pop out** - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others?

There are many ways of drawing attention to specific parts of a visual, and many of them leverage pre-attentive attributes like line length, size, line width, shape, enclosure, hue, and intensity.

**Grouping** - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data?

Consider the proximity, similarity, enclosure, connectedness, and continuity of the channel.

But, remember: the more you emphasize different things, the less that emphasis counts. The more you emphasize one single thing, the more that counts.

## Connecting images with data

### Bar Graphs

Use size contrast to compare two or more values.

Usually there will be x-axis and y-axis. X-axis is used to represent categories, time periods, or other variables, The Y-axis usually has a scale of values for the variables. Bar graphs are a great way to clarify trends.

### Line Graphs

Help your audience understand shift or changes in your data over time.

### Pie charts

Show how much each part of something makes up the whole.

### Maps

Help organize data geographically.

## A recipe for a powerful visualization

One of your biggest consideration when creating a data visualization is where you'd like your audience to focus.

### Histogram

A chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges.

### Correlation charts

Show relationship among data

### Causation

Occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome.

### Static & Dynamic visualization

`Static` visualization do not change over time unless they are edited.

`Dynamic` visualization that are interactive or change over time.

### Line charts

A line chart is used to track changes over short and long periods of time. When smaller changes exist, line charts are better to use than bar graphs. Line charts can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.

### Column chart

Column charts use size to contrast and compare two or more values, using height or lengths to represent the specific values.

### Heatmap

Similar to bar charts, heatmaps also use color to compare categories in a data set. They are mainly used to show relationships between two variables and use a system of color-coding to represent different values.

### Scatter plot

Scatter plots show relationships between different variables. Scatter plots are typically used for two variables for a set of data, although additional variables can be displayed.

### Distribution graph

A distribution graph displays the spread of various outcomes in a dataset.
