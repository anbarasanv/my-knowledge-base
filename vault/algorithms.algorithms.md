## Algorithms

Algorithms are process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

### Characteristics of algorithms

- **Input:** 0 or more
- **Output:** at least one output
- **Definiteness:** Unambiguous
- **Finiteness:** Duration of algorithm should be finite
- **Effectiveness:** Unnecessary steps are not allowed

### How to write an algorithm

Algorithm for swapping two numbers:

```math
swap(a b)
Begin
    temp := a
    a := b
    b := temp
End
```
