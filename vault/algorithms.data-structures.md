- Efficiency is the ability of a program to perform a task in a given amount of time.
- Algorithms and data structures are used to solve problems that are difficult to solve with brute force.
- The efficiency of an algorithm is the time it takes to solve a problem.
- The time it takes to solve a problem is the time it takes to perform the algorithm on a given input.

## Collections

- Collections are data structures that store a collection of data.
- Data in the collection are not necessarily of the same type.
- Data in the collection are not necessarily in the same order or follow a pattern of some sort.
