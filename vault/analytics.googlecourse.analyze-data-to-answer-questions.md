### The analysis process

The process used to make sense of the data is collected.

The goal of analysis is to identify trends and relationships within data, so you can accurately answer question you're asking.

#### The phases of analysis

1. Organize data
2. Format and adjust data
3. Get input from others
4. Transform data

### Organize data for analysis

The organization of datasets is really important for data analysts. Most of the datasets you will use will be organized as tables. Tables are helpful because they let you manipulate your data and categorize it. Having distinct categories and classifications lets you focus on, and differentiate between, your data quickly and easily.

Data analysts also need to format and adjust data when performing an analysis. **Sorting** and **filtering** are two ways you can keep things organized when you format and adjust data to work with it. For example, a filter can help you find errors or outliers, so you can fix or flag them before your analysis. **Outliers** are data points that are very different from similarly collected data and might not be reliable values. The benefit of filtering the data is that after you fix errors or identify outliers, you can remove the filter and return the data to its original organization.

### Customized sort order

When you sort data in a spreadsheet using multiple conditions, you can specify the order of the sorting.

### Data Formatting

Data formatting is a process that helps you organize and format data for analysis.

In correctly formatted data can:

- Leads to mistakes
- Take time to fix
